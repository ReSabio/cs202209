# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)


- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, 柯立丹"
print(a[5])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```

- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Go Tigers!"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
**
- Looping Through a String**

``` python
for x in "Dadalong":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"

``` python
a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 33 = 31 letter 2 space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("HDJSAdhj" in txt) == > True
print("HJSAdh" in txt)  # False
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HDJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.")
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")
```
