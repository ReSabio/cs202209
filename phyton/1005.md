# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, 柯立丹"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```

- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Go Tigers!"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
**
- Looping Through a String**

``` python
for x in "OLIVER":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Learning My Python"
print(len(a))

# wrong: print(length(a))
# correct: print(len(a))
```

QUIZ: Tell me how many char appear in "Learning My Python"

``` python
a = "Learning My Python"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# correct: print(len(a))
# 18 = 16 Letters & 2 Space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "Learning Python is FUN"
# print("FUN" in txt) == > True
# print("FAN" in txt) == > False
print("FAN" in txt)  # False
```

``` python
txt = "Learning Python is FUN. Not Easy, Not Hard"
if "Easy" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'Easy' is present.")
```






```
**- Negative Indexing**
``` python
b = "Hello, OLIVER!"
print(b[-2:-3])
# -2 not included
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
b = "Hello, OLIVER!"
print(b.upper())
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, OLIVER! "
print(b.strip())
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
- `seperator`
``` python
b = " Hello, OLIVER! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))
```

```python
b = " Hello, OLIVER! "
print(b.split(","))
```

```python
b = " Hello, OLIVER! "
print(b.split("D"))
```

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the `+` operator.
```python
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "OLIver"
d = a + b + c
print(d)
```

- Python - Format - Strings
```python
age = 10
txt = "My name is OLIVER, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
```


```python
quantity = 1
itemno = 234
price = 56
myorder = "I want {2} pieces of item {0} for {1} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```


- String Methods

- Capitalize
```python
txt = "hello, go tigers!."
x = txt.capitalize()
print (x)

``` python

```

``` python

```

``` python

```

``` python

```
