# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, 柯立丹"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```

- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Go Tigers!"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
**
- Looping Through a String**

``` python
for x in "OLIVER":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Learning My Python"
print(len(a))

# wrong: print(length(a))
# correct: print(len(a))
```

QUIZ: Tell me how many char appear in "Learning My Python"

``` python
a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# correct: print(len(a))
# 19 = 16 Letters & 2 Space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "Learning Python is FUN"
# print("FUN" in txt) == > True
# print("FAN" in txt) == > False
print("FAN" in txt)  # False
```

``` python
txt = "Learning Python is FUN. Not Easy, Not Hard"
if "Easy" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'Easy' is present.")
```
